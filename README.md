# Ad-world---Smart-Advertisement
Improve the consumer marketing designation by counting the number of visitors visited a particular ad published.

The main idea of the project is to know how many visitors are interested in a particular Ad and design a system which can predict the number of visitors who are actually interested in it. The ads here refer to billboards on public places and public transports.

Objectives of this project is to design a system with following requirements:
1) To detect visitor standing in front of Ad with non-contact measurement (range 400cm).
2) Turn the camera on when a visitor is detected in front of Ad.
3) Capture 5 consecutive images with minute intervals of time.
4) Face detection in those 5 images using Convolutional Neural Network.
5) Count up when face detected for a threshold number of images.
6) Periodic updates via email to advertisers on number of views.
7) The view count is stored in text file Individual_Samples.txt.
